Coffee Sharing
==============

A web 2.0 community website for people who are volunteer to pay coffee for free to people who can't afford it.
It comes from the "caffe sospeso" tradition, born Italy's southern city of Naples.

Be free to fork the project and propose your improvements. ;)

Brainstorming
-------------

Note: Give all your ideas. This is only a simple website coded quickly. Nothing existed and I thought that people needed something since it's not easy to know which place accept suspended coffees otherwise. Some of them seems to refuse the movement. If you have any question/remarks/advices/ideas, drop me a mail at the address above or use http://coffeesharing.uservoice.com/.

* Pay online for a suspended coffee (complicated to send back the money)
* People can vote for coffee places (cheat? :s)
* Rank system (like foursquare... but would it kill the anonymous part?)
* Online shop (minimal prices, no money taken by admins)
* Better design?!

* Cache
* Add category
